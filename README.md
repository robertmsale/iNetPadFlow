# iNetPadFlow
Stream gamepad inputs from iPhone to Mac over the local network

## Why?
Apple Silicon Macs are becoming powerful gaming computers. The list of AAA titles available on the app store is growing steadily. Other operating systems have game streaming solutions such as Steam Link, Parsec, etc. Well you can already Airplay stream your Mac to your Apple TV, but your gamepad can only go as far as the wireless signal will take it. So if you were planning on Airplay streaming your game to a TV on the other side of the house, think again!

This app aims to bridge the gap between your gamepad and your computer by letting you pair your bluetooth gamepad to your iPhone and sending the inputs to your Mac. Now you can Airplay to your Apple TV and not have to worry about physical distance of the gamepad from the Mac!

## How?
iNetPadFlow is a two-part solution where you connect a compatible gamepad to your iPhone, and on Mac you have a driver and companion service which receives gamepad controls from the iPhone over the local network.
